This document discusses the concept of grounding in the context of using large language models (LLMs) like Microsoft's GPT models. Grounding refers to the process of providing LLMs with specific, relevant information to ensure the quality and accuracy of their generated output. LLMs have a vast amount of general knowledge but lack specific use-case information. Grounding can be achieved through techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning. RAG involves retrieving relevant information and providing it to the LLM along with a prompt, while fine-tuning involves additional training to infuse the model with task-specific information. Grounding has various applications, including search and question-answering systems, content generation, retrieving information from APIs, and memory and state management. The document also discusses techniques and tools for vector indexing and retrieval, such as semantic search, vector indexes and databases, and the use of metadata. It highlights the tradeoffs between speed, cost, and quality/accuracy when working with LLMs and provides tips for optimizing performance. Overall, grounding is essential for leveraging the power of LLMs in local marketing and other applications.
